# Iris Flower Classification

A simple **RandomForest-based classifier** for the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. Using four features—**sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**—the model typically achieves **90–98% accuracy** depending on hyperparameter tuning.

## How It Works:
1. **Load the Iris dataset** (3 classes, 150 samples).  
   Dataset link: [Iris Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)
2. **Split the data** into training and testing sets.
3. **Train a RandomForest classifier** on the training set.
4. **Evaluate the model** using the testing set and report accuracy, which usually falls between **90% (basic)** and **98% (tuned)**.

This dataset is widely used for educational purposes, making it a great starting point for classification problems.
