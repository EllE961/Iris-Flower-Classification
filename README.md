# Iris Flower Classification

A simple RandomForest-based classifier for the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). Using four features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—the model typically achieves **90–98% accuracy** depending on hyperparameter tuning.

How It Works:
- Load the Iris dataset (3 classes, 150 samples).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a RandomForest classifier.
- Report accuracy, which usually falls between 90% (basic) and 98% (tuned).
